# Git Reference Notes

## Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project. It tracks changes to files and allows you to easily revert to previous versions if needed.

## Git Basics

- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone <repository>`: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.
- `git add <file>`: Adds a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "<message>"`: Commits the changes in the staging area with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Pushes the committed changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.

## Branching and Merging

- `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
- `git branch <branch-name>`: Creates a new branch.
- `git checkout <branch-name>`: Switches to a different branch.
- `git merge <branch-name>`: Merges changes from a different branch into the current branch.

## Remote Repositories

- `git remote add <name> <url>`: Adds a remote repository.
- `git remote -v`: Lists all remote repositories.
- `git fetch <remote>`: Fetches changes from a remote repository.
- `git pull <remote> <branch>`: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository.
- `git push <remote> <branch>`: Pushes changes to a remote repository.

## Additional Git Commands

- `git status`: Shows the status of the repository.
- `git log`: Displays the commit history.
- `git diff`: Shows the differences between commits, branches, or files.

For more detailed information, refer to the official Git documentation.

Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration in software development. It provides a wide range of commands and features that enable efficient management of code changes. By understanding the basics of Git, you can effectively track and manage your project's history, collaborate with other developers, and easily revert to previous versions if needed.

In the "Git Basics" section, we covered essential commands such as `git init`, which initializes a new Git repository, and `git clone`, which creates a local copy of a remote repository. The `git add` command allows you to add files to the staging area, and `git commit` commits the changes with a descriptive message. `git push` and `git pull` are used to push and fetch changes to and from a remote repository, respectively.

Branching and merging are crucial aspects of Git. With `git branch`, you can list all branches in the repository, and `git branch <branch-name>` creates a new branch. The `git checkout` command allows you to switch between branches, and `git merge` merges changes from one branch into another.

Managing remote repositories is made easy with Git. The `git remote add` command adds a remote repository, and `git remote -v` lists all remote repositories. `git fetch` fetches changes from a remote repository, while `git pull` fetches and merges changes. `git push` is used to push changes to a remote repository.

In addition to the basics, Git provides additional commands for more advanced usage. `git status` shows the status of the repository, `git log` displays the commit history, and `git diff` shows the differences between commits, branches, or files.

For more detailed information and advanced usage, it is recommended to refer to the official Git documentation. It provides comprehensive documentation and guides to help you make the most out of Git.
